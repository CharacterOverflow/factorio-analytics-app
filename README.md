# factorio-analytics-app

#### Version 1.0.0

A basic frontend for the Public Factorio Analytics API

Runs a standard trial for any submitted blueprints, and shows a page that loads that standard trial.

Will likely be using this as a starting point to add more features

#### This it not yet fully outlined, I really just put it together over the course of a week. I'm unsure how much I want to maintain, and if others add benchmarking to their own sites I will likely just point you to theirs.
